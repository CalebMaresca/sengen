This project is for developing SenGen. SenGen is a Python package designed to generate interactive scenarios for training and evaluating LLM-based reinforcement learning agents, with a particular focus on ethical decision making and AI safety.

Here are some important docs you may need.
Langchain: docs/langchain_llms.txt
Langgraph: docs/langgraph_llms.txt

The API for both LangChain and LangGraph have changed multiple times, so you will want to reference the docs and not rely solely on your own knowledge.
